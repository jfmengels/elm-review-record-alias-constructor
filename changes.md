# changelog

#### 1.0.1

Corrected a bug where top-level functions were only notices when the module exposes (..).

#### 1.0.2

Put parens around auto-generated lambda fixes.

#### 1.0.3

Avoid a [bug in expression printing](https://github.com/the-sett/elm-syntax-dsl/issues/32) by providing fixes for the arguments first.
